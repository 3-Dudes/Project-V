    To conclude the second semester of a college-level introductory Computer Science course at our high school, 
    our teacher assigned us the opportunity to create a program of our choice, typically in favor of a video game.
    Being massive fans of the platform fighter genre (Super Smash Bros and Multiversus), the hero shooter genre (Overwatch and Team Fortress 2),
    and Universal's most remarkable movie series: Despicable Me, we decided to do our choice of program by combining these three concepts into
    a innovative ranged fighting game: <strong> Project-V </strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Project-Vector, shortened to Project-V, is a ranged fighting game where 
    two players have the chance to show their true fighting style by utilizing ranged combat 
    in colorful and chaotic arenas, with a cast from Universal's beloved franchise: <strong> Despicable Me </strong>. Each player will have
    their own moveset consisting of a primary fire, an alt fire, three abilities, and an ultimate ability. Utilize this moveset for your player 
    in order to your knock your opponent's health down to zero and be considered victorious!
